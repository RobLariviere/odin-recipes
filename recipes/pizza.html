    <h3> Classic Homemade Pizza</h3>
    <p> By using direct high heat from two directions (hot skillet on bottom, broiler on top), these pizzas cook in 1 to 2 minutes. The recipe is enough for multiple pies; the best way is to make one, watch it disappear in seconds, then make another and repeat so you’re always eating fresh, piping-hot, crispy-edged pizza.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>

<ul>     
    <li>1 (1-pound) ball of store-bought pizza dough (or your favorite recipe for 1 large pizza) </li>

    <li>1 (14-ounce) can whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons blond or light miso, plus more to taste</li>

    <li>1 (8-ounce) ball buffalo (or other fresh) mozzarella, thinly sliced</li>

    <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

    <li>1 bunch fresh basil</li>

</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

<ol start=1>
    <li>Arrange a rack in the upper third of the oven, turn broiler to high and put a 12-inch cast iron (or other very heavy, oven-safe) skillet on the rack. Working on a lightly floured surface, divide the pizza dough into three equal-sized pieces, knead each piece for 2 minutes, arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 30 to 45 minutes. </li>

    <li> While dough is resting, make the pizza sauce by combining the tomatoes with their can juices, and the salt in a medium bowl and use your hands to crush the tomatoes into smaller pieces. </li>

    <li>Once dough has rested, uncover and transfer a piece to a floured work surface. Dust a rolling pin with flour and roll out dough into a 10- to 12-inch round (or as close to round as you can get).  </li>

    <li>Now, clear space on your stovetop and have all your ingredients ready and nearby because you’re going to need to work fast. Using 2 oven mitts, pull the skillet from the oven and set on the stovetop. </li>

    <li>Lift the pizza dough and place it on the hot skillet, then quickly spread 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over the dough, followed by ½ cup of the tomato sauce. Scatter about a third of the mozzarella on top of the sauce and (again using oven mitts) quickly return the pizza to the oven and cook, checking every minute or two to prevent burning, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust develops blackened bubbles that look like leopard spots, 8 to 9 minutes</li>

    <li>Remove from oven, and tear some basil right on top. Use 2 spatulas to lift the pizza out to a cutting board. </li>

    <li>Cut into 6 slices and enjoy, then repeat 2 more times with the remaining dough, sauce, cheese, and basil, letting the skillet heat in the oven for at least 10 minutes between batches.</li>
